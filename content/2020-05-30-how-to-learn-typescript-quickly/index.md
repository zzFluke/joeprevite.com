  - who am I
  - credibility (I learned TypeScript quickly)
  - what's the point of this guide

A few months back, I set out a goal to learn TypeScript deeply in 3 months. And I did it! Since then, others have asked how they can do the same. This guide will provide a framework for you to do the same. It's called the "Fast Framework."

Imagine you're in Mario Kart and racing on a new map. You will only have achieved your goal if you cross the finishline. We'll break it into three phases:

- [ ] TODO Finish the analogy of the mario kart
- "Make Your Map" - Vision / Timeframe / Timeline / Organization
- "Stay on Track" - Momentum / Accountability / Sharing /
- "Find the Flag" - Practice / Confidence / Vocabulary / Depth

- [ ] TODO add excalidraw photo

## Make your Map

The first step is to make your map. This will help answer questions like:

- What does it mean to "learn TypeScript"?
- How long will the project take?
- What are the expected outcomes?
- How am I going to organize my learning project?

### Write a Clear Vision

For our vision, we will define our project and use the Objective Key Results (OKRs) framewor.  If you aren't familiar, this was popularized by the book "[Measure What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/)" and is used at companies like Google.

First, define what you expect to achieve by learning TypeScript.

In my learning project, I wrote:

> Learn TypeScript deeply and become the [Company] "in-house expert"

That will be your  **Objective**.Next, figure out how you're going to *measure* it. Think of these as the **Key Results**. Continuing with my previous project:

- Read "Programming TypeScript" by Boris Cherny

- Read the [Official TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

- Produce small code examples for all concepts

- Contribute to TypeScript, [the language](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue")
- Contribute to [typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

Great. We have clarity on what we mean when we say "learn TypeScript." and we know what outcomes we expect.

### Establish a Timeframe

We don't want to be racing on this map forever. We need to be realistic and ask ourselves how much time we have for this.

Estimating time to complete tasks in software is hard. We'll try our best by using something I like to call the **Timeframe Formula**:

- [ ] TODO draw picture of timeframe formula

Take the length of months you want to work on this, divide by 4 to give us weeks. Then multiple it by the number of hours per week that you want to dedicate.

For example, when I did a similar project, I gave myself 3 months with 8 hours per week. Using the Timeframe Formula, we get:

- [ ] TODO draw picture with my example (3 *4) * 8 = 96 hours.

(3 month * 4 weeks/month) * 8 hours/week = 96 hours total.

We now have our timeframe and expectation of how much we plan to dedicate each week.

### Build a Timeline

- week by week what we will do
- keeps us on track
- think less
- not perfect, but we strive for it and readjust as needed

### Keep it Organized

- A place to keep track, log notes, check off boxes
- Check-in every day
- Tools
  - Notion, pen and paper, something else



- Keep it organized
- Build momentum
- Have accountability
- Decide where to share and
- Practice
- Tools to stay focused
- Build TypeScript Confidence
- Go for Depth
- Look for Patterns
