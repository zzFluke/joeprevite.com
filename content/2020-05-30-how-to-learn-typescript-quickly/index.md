- introduction
  - who am I
  - credibility (I learned TypeScript quickly)
  - what's the point of this guide

A few months back, I set out a goal to learn TypeScript deeply in 3 months. And I did it! Since then, others have asked how they can do the same. This guide will provide a framework for you to do the same. It's called the "Fast Framework."

Imagine you're in Mario Kart and racing on a new map. You will only have achieved your goal if you cross the finishline. We'll break it into three phases:

- [ ] TODO Finish the analogy of the mario kart
- "Make Your Map" - Vision / Timeframe / Timeline / Organization
- "Stay on Track" -  Accountability / Momentum / Sharing / Focus
- "Find the Flag" - Practice / Confidence / Vocabulary / Depth
- [ ] TODO add excalidraw photo
- [ ] TODO fix we/you
- [ ] add small wins article
- [ ] check motivation hacker success spiral definition
- [ ] check star wars quote
- [ ] replace -- with em dash

## Make your Map

The first step is to make your map. This will help answer questions like:

- What does it mean to "learn TypeScript"?
- How long will the project take?
- What are the expected outcomes?
- How am I going to organize my learning project?

### Write a Clear Vision

For our vision, we will define our project and use the Objective Key Results (OKRs) framewor.  If you aren't familiar, this was popularized by the book "[Measure What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/)" and is used at companies like Google.

First, define what you expect to achieve by learning TypeScript.

In my learning project, I wrote:

> Learn TypeScript deeply and become the [Company] "in-house expert"

That will be your  **Objective**.Next, figure out how you're going to *measure* it. Think of these as the **Key Results**. Continuing with my previous project:

- Read "Programming TypeScript" by Boris Cherny

- Read the [Official TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

- Produce small code examples for all concepts

- Contribute to TypeScript, [the language](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue")
- Contribute to [typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

Great. We have clarity on what we mean when we say "learn TypeScript." and we know what outcomes we expect.

### Establish a Timeframe

We don't want to be racing on this map forever. We need to be realistic and ask ourselves how much time we have for this.

Estimating time to complete tasks in software is hard. We'll try our best by using something I like to call the **Timeframe Formula**:

- [ ] TODO draw picture of timeframe formula

Take the length of months you want to work on this, divide by 4 to give us weeks. Then multiple it by the number of hours per week that you want to dedicate.

For example, when I did a similar project, I gave myself 3 months with 8 hours per week. Using the Timeframe Formula, we get:

- [ ] TODO draw picture with my example (3 *4) * 8 = 96 hours.

(3 month * 4 weeks/month) * 8 hours/week = 96 hours total.

We now have our timeframe and expectation of how much we plan to dedicate each week.

### Build a Timeline

The next thing we need to add to our map is a timeline. Think of this as a week by week calendar. It helps you think less because you have already decided what to do for that week. It won't be perfect. You may need to readjust, but at least you've established the framing. 

An example:

- [ ] Week 1 (June 1)
  - [ ] Programming TypeScript
    - [ ] Chapter 1 - Introduction 
    - [ ] Chapter 2 - TypeScript: a 10_000 foot view
      - [ ] Book exercises
    - [ ] Chapter 3 - All About Types
      - [ ] Book exercises 
  - [ ] Official TypeScript Handbook (OTH)
    - [ ] Basic Types
    - [ ] Variable Declarations 

You know yourself best. Think back to our Timeframe Formula. We estimated 8hrs/week and 12 weeks in total. Knowing the speed that you read it, you would adjust accordingly. A complete timeline would have weeks 1-12 filled out. 

Two important tips:

1. Leave a week or two for buffer towards the end (you may need it)
2. Give yourself some breathing room

Life comes up and you may fall behind. That's where the buffer comes in! Some weeks, you may find that you complete everything in 6 hours. No need to fill those two other hours if you don't want to. Use it to breath. 

With your timeline, you'll be good to go!

### Keep it Organized

You want to stay organized on this journey. That means a place to keep track of your timeline, log any notes or things you learn and have visual indicators for the progress you're making.

I use Notion for this becauase it supports this type of project management really well. I make a place for the project. I add the timeline and use checkboxes. Then I check them off as I go and take notes as I learn new things. 

Here are a list of tools you might want to check out:

- Notion
- Trello
- Asana
- GitHub Projects

It goes without saying that you could also use an analog tool like pen and paper.

## Stay on Track 

Now that we have our map, we are ready for the next phase: stay on track. 

In this phase, the goal is develop systems that help us stay accountable, build momentum, share with others and stay focused.

### Keep Yourself Accountable

You always want someway to stay accountable for your project. Think of this like your race crew (if Mario had one). They make sure you're fueled, your tires are rotated and you're ready to finish the race. We want a similar type of support and accountability.

It could be:

- a group of friends 
- a family member 
- a friend online

All you need is at least one person with whom you can share updates. They don't have to know TypeScript or even know how to code. But they do need to be someone whom you can check-in with on a regular basis. For TypeScript, I recommend looking for 2-3 people who will join you in your TypeScript journey. I would post:

- on Twitter, using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag or #CodeNewbie
- on Dev.to, starting a discussion and sharing the project
- on the TypeScript Discord

Between these three, I am 99.9% sure you'll find success. 2-3 is ideal, but at least 1 other person.

### Build Momentum 

You want momentum. Momentum will keep you going on the track and heading towards the finish line.

Think **small wins**, **milestones** and **success spirals**.

Small wins are the little accomplishments that we oftentimes take for granted. Examples are things like learning a new concept or finishing a chapter in book. Celebrate these.

Milestones are the next step up. These can either be date-based or achievment-based. Date-based would be hitting the 1-month mark in your 3-month timeframe for your learning project. Achievement-based would be finishing one of your key results. Either way, these are things to be celerbated and help you sustain the momentum.

Success spiral is a term I first heard in Motivation Hack by Nick Winter. It's the idea that you set yourself up for success for starting small and moving outwards, like a spiral. In this case with TypeScript, maybe you say, "I'm going to write one line of TypeScript a day." Sounds trivial, right? Good, it should. You start there, establish the habit, then build upwards and outwards. Upwards meaning you continue doing it everyday. Outwards meaning you increase the lines of code (without losing the habit). 

### Share with Others

One of the most important parts of staying on track is sharing with others and Learning in Public. There are various mediums you can choose from for sharing. 

- Tweets
- Blog Posts
- Podcasts
- Videos
- Tutorials
- Courses

Any of these ways work - and there are probably more I didn't list. This will help you for a number of reasons:

- Help you retain what you're learning
- Build expertise in the area
- Meet others who are learning

When I was learning TypeScript, I tweeted as I learned. Not only did I meet other TypeScript community members, but people corrected me or taught me new things. Towards the end, people started tweeted me asking for TypeScript help. I didn't always know the answer, but my sharing with others and learning in public helped me build **reputation** and **credibility**. 

I even ended up attracting the attention of an editor for a tech blog who paid me to write a few TypeScript articles for them. As you can see, it pays to share with others.
