  - what's the point of this guide

A few months back, I set out a goal to learn TypeScript deeply in 3 months. And I did it! Since then, others have asked how they can do the same. This guide will provide a framework for you to do the same. It's called the "Fast Framework."

Imagine you're in Mario Kart and racing on a new map. You will only have achieved your goal if you cross the finishline. We'll break it into three phases:

- [ ] TODO Finish the analogy of the mario kart
- "Make Your Map" - Vision / Timeframe / Timeline / Organization
- "Stay on Track" -  Accountability / Momentum / Sharing / Focus
- "Find the Flag" - Practice / Confidence / Vocabulary / Depth
- [ ] TODO add excalidraw photo
- [ ] TODO fix we/you
- [ ] add small wins article
- [ ] check motivation hacker success spiral definition
- [ ] check star wars quote
- [ ] replace -- with em dash
- [ ] add link to deep work by cal Newport
- [ ] add stretchly link
- [ ] add link to tiny compiler
- [ ] add link to Anki

## Make your Map

The first step is to make your map. This will help answer questions like:

- What does it mean to "learn TypeScript"?
- How long will the project take?
- What are the expected outcomes?
- How am I going to organize my learning project?

### Write a Clear Vision

For our vision, we will define our project and use the Objective Key Results (OKRs) framewor.  If you aren't familiar, this was popularized by the book "[Measure What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/)" and is used at companies like Google.

First, define what you expect to achieve by learning TypeScript.

In my learning project, I wrote:

> Learn TypeScript deeply and become the [Company] "in-house expert"

That will be your  **Objective**.Next, figure out how you're going to *measure* it. Think of these as the **Key Results**. Continuing with my previous project:

- Read "Programming TypeScript" by Boris Cherny

- Read the [Official TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

- Produce small code examples for all concepts

- Contribute to TypeScript, [the language](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue")
- Contribute to [typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

Great. We have clarity on what we mean when we say "learn TypeScript." and we know what outcomes we expect.

### Establish a Timeframe

We don't want to be racing on this map forever. We need to be realistic and ask ourselves how much time we have for this.

Estimating time to complete tasks in software is hard. We'll try our best by using something I like to call the **Timeframe Formula**:

- [ ] TODO draw picture of timeframe formula

Take the length of months you want to work on this, divide by 4 to give us weeks. Then multiple it by the number of hours per week that you want to dedicate.

For example, when I did a similar project, I gave myself 3 months with 8 hours per week. Using the Timeframe Formula, we get:

- [ ] TODO draw picture with my example (3 *4) * 8 = 96 hours.

(3 month * 4 weeks/month) * 8 hours/week = 96 hours total.

We now have our timeframe and expectation of how much we plan to dedicate each week.

### Build a Timeline

The next thing we need to add to our map is a timeline. Think of this as a week by week calendar. It helps you think less because you have already decided what to do for that week. It won't be perfect. You may need to readjust, but at least you've established the framing. 

An example:

- [ ] Week 1 (June 1)
  - [ ] Programming TypeScript
    - [ ] Chapter 1 - Introduction 
    - [ ] Chapter 2 - TypeScript: a 10_000 foot view
      - [ ] Book exercises
    - [ ] Chapter 3 - All About Types
      - [ ] Book exercises 
  - [ ] Official TypeScript Handbook (OTH)
    - [ ] Basic Types
    - [ ] Variable Declarations 

You know yourself best. Think back to our Timeframe Formula. We estimated 8hrs/week and 12 weeks in total. Knowing the speed that you read it, you would adjust accordingly. A complete timeline would have weeks 1-12 filled out. 

Two important tips:

1. Leave a week or two for buffer towards the end (you may need it)
2. Give yourself some breathing room

Life comes up and you may fall behind. That's where the buffer comes in! Some weeks, you may find that you complete everything in 6 hours. No need to fill those two other hours if you don't want to. Use it to breath. 

With your timeline, you'll be good to go!

### Keep it Organized

You want to stay organized on this journey. That means a place to keep track of your timeline, log any notes or things you learn and have visual indicators for the progress you're making.

I use Notion for this becauase it supports this type of project management really well. I make a place for the project. I add the timeline and use checkboxes. Then I check them off as I go and take notes as I learn new things. 

Here are a list of tools you might want to check out:

- Notion
- Trello
- Asana
- GitHub Projects

It goes without saying that you could also use an analog tool like pen and paper.

## Stay on Track 

Now that we have our map, we are ready for the next phase: stay on track. 

In this phase, the goal is develop systems that help us stay accountable, build momentum, share with others and stay focused.

### Keep Yourself Accountable

You always want someway to stay accountable for your project. Think of this like your race crew (if Mario had one). They make sure you're fueled, your tires are rotated and you're ready to finish the race. We want a similar type of support and accountability.

It could be:

- a group of friends 
- a family member 
- a friend online

All you need is at least one person with whom you can share updates. They don't have to know TypeScript or even know how to code. But they do need to be someone whom you can check-in with on a regular basis. For TypeScript, I recommend looking for 2-3 people who will join you in your TypeScript journey. I would post:

- on Twitter, using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag or #CodeNewbie
- on Dev.to, starting a discussion and sharing the project
- on the TypeScript Discord

Between these three, I am 99.9% sure you'll find success. 2-3 is ideal, but at least 1 other person.

### Build Momentum 

You want momentum. Momentum will keep you going on the track and heading towards the finish line.

Think **small wins**, **milestones** and **success spirals**.

Small wins are the little accomplishments that we oftentimes take for granted. Examples are things like learning a new concept or finishing a chapter in book. Celebrate these.

Milestones are the next step up. These can either be date-based or achievment-based. Date-based would be hitting the 1-month mark in your 3-month timeframe for your learning project. Achievement-based would be finishing one of your key results. Either way, these are things to be celerbated and help you sustain the momentum.

Success spiral is a term I first heard in Motivation Hack by Nick Winter. It's the idea that you set yourself up for success for starting small and moving outwards, like a spiral. In this case with TypeScript, maybe you say, "I'm going to write one line of TypeScript a day." Sounds trivial, right? Good, it should. You start there, establish the habit, then build upwards and outwards. Upwards meaning you continue doing it everyday. Outwards meaning you increase the lines of code (without losing the habit). 

### Share with Others

> Pass on what you learn, Luke..

> --Yoda

One of the most important parts of staying on track is sharing with others and Learning in Public. There are various mediums you can choose from for sharing. 

- Tweets
- Blog Posts
- Podcasts
- Videos
- Tutorials
- Courses

Any of these ways work - and there are probably more I didn't list. This will help you for a number of reasons:

- Help you retain what you're learning
- Build expertise in the area
- Meet others who are learning

When I was learning TypeScript, I tweeted as I learned. Not only did I meet other TypeScript community members, but people corrected me or taught me new things. Towards the end, people started tweeted me asking for TypeScript help. I didn't always know the answer, but my sharing with others and learning in public helped me build **reputation** and **credibility**. 

I even ended up attracting the attention of an editor for a tech blog who paid me to write a few TypeScript articles for them. As you can see, it pays to share with others.

### Keep Your Focus

The last piece I want to touch on for staying on track is keeping your focus. If you want to make it to finish line, you have to stay focused. The first and foremost is **limit your focus**. Ideally, learning TypeScript is your main focus. I wouldn't suggest doing this and learning Rust or another language or something else. Keeping your attention on one project increases the likelihood you'll stay on track.

The other thing you might want to try is **deep work**. An idea by Cal Newport, it's where you create an environment that lets you focus on that project for a certain amount of time (such as 1 hour or more). Figure out when you're most productive. For me, it's in the morning before work. I wake up early, go through my routine and then spend some time learning.

Lastly, find tools to help you stay focused. I am a big fan of the **pomodoro technique**. I have an app called Stretchly that reminds me to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and a 5-minute break every 40 minutes. This allow me to focus for that period of time and then rest. It then repeats itself like a cycle. 

## Find the Flag

The last and final leg of this learning journey is finding the flag. You want to make it to the finish line and feel accomplished when you get there. 

Here you want to use systems that will help you practice, build confidence, remember vocabulary, identify patterns and go for depth so that you find the checkered flag with flying colors.

### Practice  

Learning means nothing without practice. With your new TypeScript knowledge, you can build projects or contribute to open source. This is where the application phase of the learning cycle appears. It doesn't matter what you build, but that the act of building happens. When I was learning, I followed a tutorial to build a tiny compiler. It was written in JavaScript, which meant writing in TypeScript forced me to figure out things on my own.

Other things I did included contributing to open source. Remember our key results? Here's two of them that apply here:

- Contribute to TypeScript, [the language](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"good+first+issue")
- Contribute to [typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

This is where that happens if it hasn't already! The issues that you help with may be minor, but the practice is where you learn the most. 

### Build Confidence

You want to build confidence in whatever you learning. This will make you feel comfortable using your new knowledge. 

In the case of TypeScript, you want to build **TypeScript Confidence**. There are various ways to do this including:

- teaching others
- sharing (as we said before)
- reviewing what you've learned
- helping others

### Don't Skip Vocab 

Vocabulary is often overlooked. Don't skip out on it! It helps build confidence and it will help solidify what you know. It's also a great tool to fight imposter syndrome. Knowing the vocabulary will allow you to build expertise as well. 

To learn and remember vocabulary, use a *spaced-repetition system* such as Anki. I used it when I was studying TypeScript. You can use it to remember things such as:

- Terminology
- Concepts
- Patterns

### Go for Depth

- feynman technique
- Ultralearning

## Summary

- what did we learn, it's all about systems
- systems are x y z
